My concept or idea is a two way signal pressurizes baby alert system.  Metaphors for this system are passenger seat belt warning sign which goes off when there is a pressure on the seat and the belt is not buckled, and a wireless keychain device, which the new car model has, that unlocks the car when a person with the device gets near and locks when he or she goes away.  By these two ideas, the pressurized system senses whether a baby is in the carseat or not and when there is the baby, it sends the signal to the keychain device.  As the keychain device for the new car unlocks the car when the keychain device gets away, when the device lost the signal, it turns on the annoying sound. When the baby is picked up, another signal is sent to the device to turn off the device to make a sound.

A device to prevent infants and small babies from being forgotten in the back seat of a car is like a thin material that has a pressure sensor and three signals in it, and this material could go in between a carseat and a carseat foam.  When the material knows that the baby is in the carseat with the pressure sensor, the material sends its own signal to another device that is like a keychain that users can have it with the car key to activate the keychain device.  When the keychain device goes out of the range like 2 or 3 yards from the carseat, it turns on irritating annoying sound from the device.  When the users pick the baby up, the material under the carseat foam sends a different signal that deactivates the device that users have.  Also, the last signal goes off and the device vibrates when the battery is low.
